      <p>
        Judo isn’t just about brute strength—it’s a smart, tactical art where you let your opponent do the work. Born in
        Japan, it’s all about flipping, throwing, and grappling with ninja-like finesse. The goal? Toss or pin your
        opponent to the ground, all while staying calm and looking cool.
